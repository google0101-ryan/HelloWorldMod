# HelloWorldMod
A custom (and slightly annoying) Minecraft Mod.

# USING
To use, grab the helloWorldMod-1.0.0.jar file and place it into `~/.minecraft/mods`

# ADDING FORGE TO MINECRAFT
In order to run a mod, you need forge. go to [https://www.files.minecraftforge.net](files.minecraftforge.net "Forge Homepage"). If on windows, 
grab the Windows installer and run the .exe. if on Linux or Mac, grab the universal installer and run it with 
`java -jar **_filename_**.jar`
**YOU MUST HAVE MINECRAFT INSTALLED FOR THIS TO WORK!**
